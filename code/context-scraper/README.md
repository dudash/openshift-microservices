# CONTEXT-SCRAPER
## Automatic digging through items to find contextual matches 
This microservice provides the ability to analyze the board items to find contextual matches. These contextual matches can be other board items or things scraped from trusted internet sources. For v1 we will be using the Google [Custom Search API][1] as our engine to scrape the web. 

Here is the engine - it's currently capped on my account at 10,000 queries/day please don't abuse it. 

*PLEASE - if you run this at scale switch out the engine ID*

GUI based test here: [https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=005627457786250373845:lwanzyzfwji][3]
