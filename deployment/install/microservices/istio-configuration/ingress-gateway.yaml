# An ingress Gateway describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the 
# mesh that receives incoming HTTP/TCP connections. It configures exposed
# ports, protocols, etc. but, unlike Kubernetes Ingress Resources, does not
# include any traffic routing configuration. Traffic routing for ingress 
# traffic is instead configured using Istio routing rules, exactly in the
# same was as for internal service requests.

#
# We are using hosts="*"" below because this is a demo environment that can hop
# around from domain to domain and cluster to cluster
# Also, OpenShift *should* automatically create routes for me based on this:
