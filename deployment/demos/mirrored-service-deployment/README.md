# Mirrored Service Deployment
Deploying new versions of a service is often the trigger that induces failure in a microservices application. Even when you've done a full gamut of testing in integration and acceptance environments, things can get missed. And oftentimes it's hard to see how your new changes will work in production with production-scale and production-data. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to send some of that real load and data to a service before you had officially "released"? Mirroring traffic is one simple way to do just that.
